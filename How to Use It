1. How to Use It (High-Level)


Network


Compile & deploy on BNB Smart Chain:


Testnet: BSC Testnet (Chapel)


Mainnet: BNB Smart Chain Mainnet






Deploy (easiest via Remix):


Go to Remix → new file → paste code.


Compiler: Solidity 0.8.20 (or compatible).


Deploy using MetaMask on BSC (testnet or mainnet).




Accept Payments in Your DApp / Website


Frontend calls pay(string reference) with:


value: amount in BNB (in wei).


reference: order ID, user ID, etc.




You can also just show the contract address as a payment address; any BNB sent directly will still be logged via receive().




Withdraw Funds


As owner, call:


withdraw(amount) or


withdrawAll() to move BNB to your wallet.
